# Sorting
Time stamp for different sorting and average.

In this project, I used Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and recursive Merge Sort to sort an array of 50,000 random numbers. Each algorithm was run 10 times, recording the sorting time in nanoseconds. I then averaged the times to identify the fastest and slowest sorting methods as shown in the table. The process and results are shown below through code, tables, and images. I will attach the codes in a different file. After analyzing we found out merge sort is taking less time, this proved that merge sort is faster than insertion and bubble sort.
